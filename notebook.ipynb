    "# WHAT MAKES A CULT CLASSIC?\n",
    "### **Project Overview.**\n",
    "Stilinski movie studio is a production company that produces Horror films in Africa. Due to its recent success, the company has felt the need to diversify its portfolio and has identified cult films as an exciting new production branch. However, due to the fact that they have only produced horror films and have no idea on anything about cult films, they have commission us to find out what makes a cult classic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is going to analyze past cult films and shows performances over the years and identify patterns or aspects that made them stand out in the box office. Our findings will help stakeholders in the company make informed decisions in the next crucial steps moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Business Understanding.**\n",
    "The film industry as a whole involves understanding how films are developed, financed, produced, distributed and monetized. In order to make informed decisions on those areas, we are going to explore the patterns or aspects of cult films currently doing well, and let our findings guide our recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The industry is characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High upfront investment with uncertain returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global and local market reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revenue from multiple channels, including;\n",

    "  - Box office ticket sales\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "  - DVD/Blu-ray sales\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement.\n",
    "Stilinski Company, having operated outside of cult film production but also inside of the film industry, is in a very intresting position as its journeying into a new, yet not very new territory. It's knowledge of how movie production works places it ahead and maybe even in a unique position as intergrating the world of horror and cult may give birt to something the audience has actually been waiting for.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to give answers to the following question;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What makes a cult classic?\n",

    "\n",
    "- Consistently producing quality, successful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having different revenue Streams beyond box office earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Films should receive favorable reviews and ratings on platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Awards and Industry Recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders.\n",
